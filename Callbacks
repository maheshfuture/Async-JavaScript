Why do we use callbacks?
When doing a complex task, we break that task down into smaller steps. To help us establish a relationship between these steps according to time (optional) and order, we use callbacks


let order = (call_production) =>{

console.log("Order placed. Please call production")

// function ðŸ‘‡ is being called 
  call_production();
};

let production = () =>{

console.log("Production has started")

};

let production = () =>{

  setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("production has started")
  },0000)

};
